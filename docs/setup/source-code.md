# SOURCE CODE SETUP (GitHub)

Our approach for establishing the full development ecosystem for your solution starts first with setting up a repository to store you code.

1. [Setup GitHub Account.](https://github.com/)
1. Create a new repo using [this repo](https://github.com/boundbybetter/better-template) as the template.  At the top right of the repo in GitHub click the green 'Use this template' button and select 'Create a new repository'.
