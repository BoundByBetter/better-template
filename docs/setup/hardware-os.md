# HARDWARE & OS SETUP

In developing this solution below is the physical setup that was used:

## DEV MACHINE:

```
Device type: Surface Book 3
Device Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1065G7 CPU @ 1.30GHz   1.50 GHz
Device Installed RAM: 32.0 GB (31.6 GB usable)
Device System type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
OS Edition: Windows 11 Pro
OS Version: 23H2
OS build: 22631.4037
OS Serial number: 027137101757
OS Experience: Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.22700.1027.0
```
I would not recommend this device for Android development.  I was not able to get an android emulator to work with satisfactory performance.  As a result I used a physical android device for development.
